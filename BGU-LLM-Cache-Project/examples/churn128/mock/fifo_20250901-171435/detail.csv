The 62-year-old was found guilty of one count when he played with a Hillsborough Justice Campaign banner draped on his bagpipes in April 2015. He was cleared of the two other counts by a jury at Liverpool Crown Court. Sgt NAME_2 told the court during the two day trial that NAME_3, from Woolton, gave the impression he was collecting cash for the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. In his defence, NAME_3 - who usually wears a kilt and piper's regalia when he performs - said he had piped for the charity in the past but on this occasion he was simply busking. NAME_4, chairman of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said he had given NAME_3 permission to design and display a banner featuring the eternal flame and the word justice.  Summary: 1. A bagpipes player has been found guilty of defrauding a Hillsborough charity out of more than PS 1,000.  Is the summary factually consistent with the document?

Document: NAME_1, of Liverpool, who has played in the city centre for more than 30 years, denied three counts of fraud.

"Act as a product manager. Create a high level overview for the ""CML Serving"" product.  This new product enables a dedicated production serving environment for online ML models, Applications, model retrain pipelines and batch scoring.  Having a dedicated development environment helps customers to move faster without risking breaking their production code and without needing to build and manage custom development & production project workflows. This architecture facilitates industry best practices by enforcing versioning and immutability of deployed production artifacts. Customers can integrate these in their CI/CD pipeline, configure promotion gates and automate deployment processes. The CML Serving experience gives a single pane of glass view of all production workloads, operators have a single place where they can do their job efficiently.  The CML Serving service is tightly integrated with the CML (Model) Registry and enables deployment of artifacts.   The use case focused services enable new hybrid deployment architectures where customers can decide what services to deploy on-premise, in the cloud or across multiple clouds.",warm1,779.3135000392795,0
